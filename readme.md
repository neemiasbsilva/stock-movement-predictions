## About LSTM

LSTM are a special kind of Recurrent Neural Network, capable of learning long-term dependencies. They were introduced by [Hochreiter & Schmidhuber (1997)](http://www.bioinf.jku.at/publications/older/2604.pdf), and were refined and popularized by many people in following works [[Sundermeyer et al. (2012)](https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/interspeech_2012/i12_0194.html), [Zhou, Chunting, et al. (2015)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.08630), [Gensler, Andr√©, et al. (2016)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7844673)].

All recurrent neural networks have the form of a chain of repeating modules of neural network. LSTM also have this chain like structure, bellow follow the module in an LSTM.

## Getting Started

### Install

Bellow, follow some of packages you have to be install for run this experiment:

- The first step is create run virtual environment (this step is optional, but I recommend):
```
  python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv
  source .virtualenv/bin/activate
```

- The second step is install Sklearn 
```
  pip install -U scikit-learn
```

- The third step is install Pandas

```
  pip install pandas
```

- After install Pandas, you need to install TensorFlow:

```
  pip install tensorflow
```

- When TensorFlow installation has finished, please install the Keras library:

```
  pip install keras
```

- And the last library was MatPlotLib for you plot some graphics to analisy the results:

```
  python -m pip install -U matplotlib
```

### Run the Experiment

After the instalations, you can run now the experiment type the following command in your terminal:

```
  sh run.sh
```

For evaluat your model, open "evaluating_experiment.ipynb" (Jupyter Notebook File) and run all the cells:
```
  jupyter-notebook evaluating_experiment.ipynb
```

__Note__: you have to specify the correct path for your load_model cell in _Jupyter Notebook_.
